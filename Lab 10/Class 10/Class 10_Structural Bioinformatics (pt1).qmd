## The PDB database

The main repository of biomolecular structure data is called the PDB found at https://www.rcsb.org

Let's see what this database contains.I went to PDB > Analyze > PDB Statistics > By Exp method and molecular type

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```

>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

>**ANSWER**: Percentage solved by X-ray is 82.83549%, while the Electron Microscopy is 10.75017%

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```

The comma in these numbers is causing them to be read as characters rather than numeric.

I can fix this by replacing"," for nothing "" with the 'sub()' function:
```{r}
x<- pdbstats$X.ray
sum ( as.numeric( sub(",","", x) ) )
```

Or I can use the **readr** package and the 'read_csv()' function

```{r}
library(readr)
pdbstats <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```

I want to clean the column names so they are all lower case and do not have spaces in them

```{r}
colnames(pdbstats)
```

```{r}
library(janitor)
df<- clean_names(pdbstats)
df
```

Total number of X-ray Structures
```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)
```

Percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray
```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)/sum(df$total) * 100
```


Total number of EM (Electron Microscopy)
```{r}
sum(df$em)/sum(df$total) * 100
```


Total number of structures
```{r}
sum(df$total)
```


>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

>**ANSWER**: The proportion of structures in the PDB that are protein is 0.8623852	

```{r}
df[1,8]/sum(df$total)
```



>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

>**ANSWER**: Professor said we are skipping this question. 

```{r}

```


## 2. Using Mol*

The main Mol* homepage at https://molstar.org/viewer/
We can input our own PDB files or just give it a PDB database accession code (4 letter PDB code)

>Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

>**ANSWER**:

```{r}

```


>Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

>**ANSWER**: The critically "conserved" water molecule in the binidng site is at rsidue number 308.

>Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

>Discussion Topic: Can you think of a way in which indinavir, or even larger ligands and substrates, could enter the binding site?

>**ANSWER**:

## 3. Introduction Bio3D in R

we can use the **bio3d** package for structural bioinformatics to read PDB data into R

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <-read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

>Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

>**ANSWER**: 198 amnio acid residues.

```{r}
length(pdbseq(pdb))
```


>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

>**ANSWER**: MK1


>Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

>**ANSWER**: 2 protein chains

Looking at the 'pdb' object in more detail

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```


Let's try a new function not yet in the bio3d package. It requires the **r3dmol** package that we need to install with 'install.packages("r3dmol")' and 'install.packages("shiny").

```{r}
source("https://tinyurl.com/viewpdb")
#view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor="pink") 
  
```

## 4. Predicting functional dynamics

We can use the 'nma()' function in bio3d to predict the large-scale functioinal motions of biomolecule 

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a trajectory of the predicted molecular motion:
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```


Professor said we will skip section 5: Comparitive structure of analysis of Adenylate Kinase.
